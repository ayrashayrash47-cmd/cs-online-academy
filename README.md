# CS Online Academy

Marketing landing page + enrollment flow + admin dashboard for CS Online
Academy, the digital tutoring arm of CS School System. Built with Next.js
(App Router), Tailwind CSS, and Prisma + SQLite.

Bilingual (English / Urdu with RTL), mobile-first, dark grey / orange / gold
brand palette.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- npm

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then edit .env, see below
npx prisma migrate deploy   # creates dev.db and applies the schema
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the landing page,
and [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) for the admin
dashboard (login with the `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`).

## Where to edit things

Everything content- and pricing-related is centralized so you shouldn't need
to touch component code for routine changes:

| What you want to change | File |
|---|---|
| Site name, tagline, subjects list, pricing (Rs. amounts), payment details, upload limits | [`src/config/site.ts`](src/config/site.ts) |
| English copy (headlines, FAQ, testimonials, etc.) | [`src/i18n/en.ts`](src/i18n/en.ts) |
| Urdu copy | [`src/i18n/ur.ts`](src/i18n/ur.ts) |
| Colors (dark grey / orange / gold palette) | CSS variables at the top of [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css) |
| Placeholder images | drop real photos into [`public/images/`](public/images) and reference them from components |

The two files (`site.ts` for one language, `en.ts`/`ur.ts` for the other)
must stay in sync — e.g. if you add a subject or pricing tier in
`site.ts`, add its label in both `en.ts` and `ur.ts`.

### Adding your real EasyPaisa / bank details

EasyPaisa is already filled in. Bank transfer is a placeholder — open
`src/config/site.ts` and fill in:

```ts
bank: {
  bankName: "[BANK_NAME]",
  accountNumber: "[BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER]",
  iban: "[IBAN]",
},
```

### Changing the admin password

Edit `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file, then restart
the server. This is a single hardcoded admin account stored in an
environment variable — **fine for a v1 single-owner site, but upgrade to a
real auth provider (e.g. NextAuth with hashed passwords) before this handles
meaningful volumes of real payment data.** Also rotate `SESSION_SECRET`
(used to sign the admin session cookie) — generate a new one with:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## How enrollment + payment verification works

This is a "pay externally, then submit proof" flow — there is **no live
payment gateway integration**. A student:

1. Picks a plan on the pricing section.
2. Pays via EasyPaisa (or bank transfer) using the account details shown
   on the page.
3. Fills out the enrollment form and uploads a screenshot of the payment.
4. Their submission is saved with status `pending` and the screenshot is
   stored in `public/uploads/` (local disk — fine for v1; swap for
   Cloudinary or similar if you outgrow shared hosting storage).

You then review submissions in `/admin`, and mark each one **Verified** or
**Rejected**. The dashboard shows totals, pending/verified counts, and
estimated monthly revenue (verified students × their plan price), and lets
you search/filter and export everything to CSV.

## Database

SQLite via Prisma, stored at `dev.db` in the project root (path controlled
by `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`). To inspect or edit data directly:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

If you change `prisma/schema.prisma`, create a migration with:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name <description>
```

To move to PostgreSQL later (e.g. when growing beyond shared hosting),
change the `datasource` provider in `prisma/schema.prisma`, update
`DATABASE_URL`, and swap the driver adapter in `src/lib/db.ts`
(currently `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`) for the Postgres adapter.

## Deployment

This app needs a Node.js server (it uses API routes, file uploads, and a
SQLite file on disk) — it is **not** a static export, so it can't go on
Vercel/Netlify as-is (those wipe local disk on every deploy). It runs well
on Railway, Render, or any host with persistent storage that runs
`npm run build && npm start`.

`npm start` already runs `prisma migrate deploy` automatically before
starting the server, so the database schema is always up to date on boot.

### Deploying to Railway (recommended)

1. Push this repo to GitHub (see below).
2. At [railway.app](https://railway.app), sign up (GitHub sign-in is
   easiest) → **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** → pick this
   repo. Railway auto-detects it's a Node/Next.js app.
3. **Add a persistent volume** mounted at `/app/data` — this is where the
   SQLite database *and* uploaded payment screenshots both live (see
   `src/lib/paths.ts` — uploads are stored as a sibling of the database
   file, so one volume covers both). Without this, every deploy wipes
   your enrollment data and uploaded screenshots.
4. Go to **Variables** and add:
   - `DATABASE_URL` = `file:/app/data/dev.db`
   - `ADMIN_USERNAME` = `admin` (or your choice)
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` = a strong password (**do not reuse the local dev
     password**)
   - `SESSION_SECRET` = a random 64-character hex string — generate with
     `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`
5. Click **Deploy**. Railway gives you a live URL like
   `https://cs-online-academy-production.up.railway.app` — this is what
   you'd put in ads or share to groups.
6. Visit `/admin` on that URL and log in with the credentials from step 4
   to confirm it works, then submit a test enrollment on the live site to
   confirm uploads + database are both persisting after a redeploy.

Later, if you buy a domain, add it under **Settings → Networking → Custom
Domain** and point your domain's DNS at the CNAME Railway gives you — no
code changes needed.

### Pushing this repo to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

(Create the empty repo on GitHub first via the "New repository" button —
don't initialize it with a README, since this repo already has one.)
